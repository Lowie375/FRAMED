# FRAMED

## A game about frame rate

*FRAMED* was a concept for a game I initially tried to create on Scratch many years ago, but never got to fully flesh out nor see through to completion.  
So, now that I have some more experience under my belt, I decided to give this concept a second chance, and give *FRAMED* the bigger, better, fresher remake it deserves.

*FRAMED* is a simple game where a lost player tries to reach a goal to escape the maze they're stuck in.
There's just one catch: **they're living in a world of variable frame rate**, and must make use of the quirks of their world to escape some otherwise impossibly difficult challenges.

*FRAMED* is designed to be a game of timing and skill for the more casual gamer while still offering suitable challenges mechanically.

## A forewarning

*FRAMED* is still in development, and as such, levels and controls may change between updates, and there will be some quirky behaviour throughout.
Additionally, while I can say that *FRAMED*'s backend is fairly robust, I can't guarantee that its UI or front-end control code will run perfectly smoothly. However, I am constantly working to improve things with each update, so things should eventually get better.

This has been your warning. Now, embrace the chaos and prepare to get *FRAMED*!

## Controls

- Use **`WASD`** or the arrow keys to move
- Use **`Q`**/**`E`** or **`0`**/**`1`** to decrease/increase frame rate
- Use **`P`** or **`7`** to pause/resume a level
- Use **`R`** or **`9`** to restart a level
- Use **`CTRL/CMD + X`** to quit the game
- Use **`CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + R`** to reset your progress
- Use **`ALT + [UNDERLINED KEY]`** or the mouse in menus to click buttons
